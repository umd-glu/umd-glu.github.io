<textarea class="user_input2" type="text" id="message" rows="4" cols="50">Dear President Pines, Provost Rice, Dean Roth, Associate Vice President Lewin, Director Dougherty, and Vice President Rossello,
    
I am concerned about the University of Maryland’s response to both the March 19th letter from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) requesting information about Chinese individuals on our campus as well as the recent cancellation of student visas/statuses and detainment of students at other campuses under the pretense of “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” Both of these are blatantly xenophobic attacks that are part of a larger assault on higher education and immigrants across the country. UMD has so far failed to openly acknowledge these issues, has neglected to inform the campus of the university response, and has done little, if anything, to publicly assure students and faculty that UMD will protect them.
    
You have failed to disclose the existence of the committee's letter to Chinese researchers, which is the absolute bare minimum that two of the five other letter recipients, Carnegie Mellon and Stanford, have done for their campus communities. Our Chinese students and faculty have the right to know  what information UMD is providing about them, and when this information was or will be turned over. This lack of openness deals a serious blow to trust in the University.
    
Likewise, the University has not acknowledged the alarming revocation of international  visa/student statuses and abductions of international scholars by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for what they are: a grievous attack on immigrants and free speech and severe political intrusion into academic functions. This wave of status revocations and detentions is unprecedented, and students need specific details about whether and how ISSS is taking proactive measures to protect them, not just vague assurances.

I demand that you:
1.  Inform Chinese students and faculty of the letter and provide them a copy of the response; this standard should be maintained in the event of future letters/requests from the federal government targeting any group of individuals in the UMD community.
2. Explicitly and publicly affirm that no personally identifiable information about Chinese nationals at UMD is being provided to the federal government (including in their capacity as employees, not just students) and share when you responded or will respond to the House Select Committee letter.
3. Hold a public town hall ASAP discussing  the University’s response to the request for information about Chinese nationals at UMD, exactly how ISSS is monitoring and informing students of changes to their visa/student status, the actions of ICE on other campuses, and whether UMD is prepared for similar actions here.
4. Reject any and all voluntary cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE.
5. Provide institutional and financial support for students, staff, and faculty who are targeted, denied entry, and/or deported and take proactive measures to prevent such violations of privacy, due process, and civil liberties.
6. Publicly reaffirm the university’s commitment to academic freedom, inclusivity, and the protection of all members of its community, regardless of national origin, race, or ethnicity.

While these issues are of critical importance to international students and faculty, they are also of great concern to the entire UMD community. Your silence plays into the hands of those directing these attacks against international students and academics by contributing to the atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and division. Your current inaction signals to students and faculty that you are not willing to inform and protect them if and when they are targeted.

Sincerely,
